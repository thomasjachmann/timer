# Timer

This just displays a full screen pi chart timer. You don't need to deploy this
anywhere, just go to http://coderei.de/timer and see it counting down, becoming
red in the end.

The default is a 5 minute countdown. But you can specify the amount of minutes
as a hash:

* [1 second](http://coderei.de/timer/#0.016666666666666667)
* [1 minute](http://coderei.de/timer/#1)
* [1 hour](http://coderei.de/timer/#60)

Double click anywhere and the timer restarts.

Feel free to add those links as a shortcut to your phone's homescreen. You'll
also get a nice icon with that.
